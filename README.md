This repository contains the code for a queueing system simulation applied to an IoT scenario. The simulation scenario involves the portion of an Internet of Things (IoT) network, consisting of a group of sensors for real-time monitoring, a Micro Data Center and a Cloud Data Center. 
Multiple experiments have been conducted under different configurations, the results are outlined in the [report](https://github.com/vincenzomadaghiele/MCDSM_labs/blob/master/MCDSM_labs_report.pdf).
